This project is for educational uses in the classroom to help elementary level kids more about our solar system.

We're using a lot of HTML, JS, and CSS to make this all work. Along side the tools we're using
NetBeans and Bootstap3.

Each planet in the system has their own information with facts about them. Along side this there will be
an interactive Javascript flash game to track progress and knowledge of the system.

We hope teachers would use this in the classroom to help teach their students more about the universe around us.
